# Credit Card Approval
Predicting if credit card request will approved for the customer given other attributes.

### Summary
In this project, I have tried to find out the factors that are most important for getting an 
approval for the credit card through the power of Data Analysis and Machine Learning. 
Though we have achieved 86% of accuracy, we also tried to check if we can improve the 
performance further and tried grid search. 
However, 86% is the best we could get from this data using both the model; 
logistic regression and random forest
